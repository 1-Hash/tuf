# This is a requirements file executed by pip and may be used for TUF development
# and installation.  It can be executed as follows:
# $ pip install --requirement dev-requirements.txt
# 
# pip install TUF (minimal install) in editable mode (i.e., setuptools
# "develop mode").  The current working directory must contain 'setup.py'.
--editable .

# Install PyNaCl for faster generation and verification of ed25519 keys and
# signatures.  It also includes protection against side-channel attacks.
# NOTE: TUF only uses the pure Python implementation of ed25519 for signature
# verification.  PyNaCl is required for ed25519 key and signature generation
# with the TUF repository tools.  Also install PyCrypto for RSA key & signature
# support and general-purpose cryptography needed by the repository tools.
